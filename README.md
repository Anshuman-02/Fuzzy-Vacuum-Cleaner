# Fuzzy Logic Controller-Based Vacuum Cleaner üåü

This repository contains the project report and MATLAB outputs for a **Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC)** designed for a robotic vacuum cleaner. The intelligent system adapts its cleaning strategy based on environmental inputs such as dirtiness level and proximity to obstacles, demonstrating the power of fuzzy logic in automation.

## üìù Problem Statement

Develop a Fuzzy Logic Controller for a robotic vacuum cleaner using MATLAB. The controller:
- Dynamically adjusts cleaning speed and patterns based on real-time inputs.
- Avoids obstacles efficiently.
- Adapts cleaning strategies based on environmental conditions.
- Uses fuzzy rules and membership functions for intelligent decision-making.
